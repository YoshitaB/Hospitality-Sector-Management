**Hospitality Sector Revenue Optimization**

**Optimizing Revenue Leakage & Profitability in the Hospitality Sector**

This project builds a data-driven framework to identify and resolve revenue leakage challenges in the hospitality sector. It analyzes weekday vs weekend occupancy, high cancellation patterns, and premium room unrealized revenue, providing actionable recommendations to maximize profitability.

**Problem Statement**

The hospitality industry suffers from:

- Low weekday occupancy (~51–55%) vs weekend (~73–79%).

- High cancellation rates (~25%), especially in Delhi via platforms like Journey (26.6%) and Tripster (26.4%).

- Significant premium room revenue leakage (highest in Presidential rooms).

- Seasonal dips in demand (June–July).

- Overdependence on OTAs (~85% of bookings), reducing profitability.

**Project Objectives**

- Identify root causes of occupancy dips, cancellations, and unrealized premium revenue.

- Apply forecasting models (e.g., WoW trends) and hospitality KPIs (Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %).

- Recommend strategies around pricing, product packaging, channel optimization, and corporate tie-ups.

- Build an interactive dashboard with SQL + visualization for real-time insights.

**Market Research Highlights**

_India’s Hospitality Market:_ USD 24.2B (2025) → USD 45.4B (2030) at ~13.4% CAGR.

_National Occupancy:_ 63.9% | ADR: ₹7,951 | RevPAR: >₹5,000 (YoY growth: 10.7%).

_OTA Share:_ ~45.5% of bookings, but direct channels growing at ~15.5% CAGR.

_Non-room revenues (F&B, banquets, spa) contribute 20–25% yet remain underutilized_

**Key Insights from EDA**

 → Cancellation rates (~25%) consistent across lead times and platforms.

 → Revenue leakage (~15%) uniform across guest ratings, platforms, and lead times.

 → Business hotels underperforming despite comparable cancellations to luxury hotels.

 → Premium rooms face highest revenue shortfalls.

**Identified Gaps**

    - Weak weekday demand strategies (corporate, events).

    - Promotions skewed towards weekends.

    - Lack of loyalty incentives for midweek stays.

    - OTA-heavy dependency with minimal direct booking push.

    -Flexible cancellation policies without protection levers.

**Proposed Solutions**

_Demand-Side:_

    - Corporate contracts & conference packages to lift weekday occupancy.

    - Seasonal demand fixes (festivals, wellness events, staycation packages).

    - Exclusive premium-room promotions (spa, transfers, F&B credits).

_Supply-Side:_

    - Dynamic pricing to balance weekday vs weekend ADR.

    - Overbooking strategies using historical cancellation data.

    - Channel reallocation + direct booking referral campaigns.

_Revenue Realization:_

    - Non-refundable discounts on OTAs.

    - Free rescheduling in short-lead cancellations.

    - Corporate tie-ups and “workation” packages with co-working spaces.

**Frameworks Applied**

-> McKinsey’s Profitability Framework → Revenue = Price × Volume.

-> BCG’s Revenue Tree → Demand (Volume), Mix (Segment/Channel), Price (ADR/RevPAR).

-> Bain’s Revenue Leakage Lens → Protect realized vs potential revenue.

**Business Impact (ROI & Payback)**

      - Cancellation Reduction: 15–35%.

      - Weekday Occupancy Uplift: 4–12%.

      - OTA Share Shift to Direct: 5–12%.

      - ROI: 120–200% | Payback: ≤ 6–12 months.
